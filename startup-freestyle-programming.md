**CMSI 185** Computer Programming, Fall 2016

# Assignment 0927

Start your keyboards! This assignment aims to get you coding…maybe for the rest of your life **:)** I call this assignment “freestyle” because it is not focused on any particular concept or technique—it simply seeks to get you to put something together that you’ll be proud of, and ideally enjoy doing it.

To help you put something together without having to learn too much (yet), you’ll be writing code in the two somewhat “augmented” environments shown in class: Khan Academy and JSFiddle. You will be writing genuine JavaScript, but the environments have additional built-in features for accomplishing more with less code.

## Background Reading
Don’t hesitate to review or re-read the content from [Assignment 0906](http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/fall2016/cmsi185/cmsi185-fall2016-hw0906.pdf), especially the textbook readings and the [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/getting-started-v2/0/1) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) online tutorials.

## For Submission

Because we’re all just getting started here, for this assignment you may work in pairs. Make sure to work equitably; a concrete technique for fostering that is to take turns “driving,” with one person at the keyboard and the other talking through the work. Periodically, trade places (and user accounts, where applicable). It’s a well-established method, known as [_pair programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).

### Choose Two of Each
Write a total of four (4) short programs, two (2) from each category below. Save them in your designated repositories as individual, standalone files. This will give you practice with the GitHub website.

Because Khan Academy and JSFiddle provide environments that assist with ensuring code correctness, this assignment does not have the automated checking that was mentioned in the syllabus. Instead, just make sure that your programs work as expected in their respective environments. A good “clean room” test is to restart with a clean slate in those environments, then copy-paste your code directly into them. They should work as-is—in fact, this is how your work will be graded.

Each program is worth 25 points. First and foremost, they must run without errors and should accomplish whatever the specification requests. Second, they must show a more or less equitable balance of work between pair partners—although this cannot be absolutely monitored, you can at least manifest it by taking turns with submitting the code to GitHub (under your respective user accounts).

For this assignment, glitches with code formatting or presentation will be pointed out but will not result in deductions, unless the formatting issue is particularly egregious (i.e., so far removed from the code that you’ve seen and what the environments provide by default that they need to be corrected ASAP).

### Khan Academy Animations
The descriptions here are intentionally bare-bones to give you the freedom to go wild. Feel free to add more elements, “actors,” and scenery than specified here.

- An animation of a ball flying over a volleyball net, in a trajectory that looks like a really good volleyball serve. Humans do not have to be in the scene, but if they are, they don’t need to be animated. Save the code in a file called _volleyball.js_.
- An animation of a moon orbiting around a planet, with a rocket taking of from the planet then landing on the moon. Save this code in a file called _rocket.js_.
- An animation of two cars racing across an infinitely scrolling landscape, periodically trading leads. Save this code in a file called _race.js_.
- An animation of a plane landing on a runway. Save the code in a file called _landing.js_.
- An animation of a [Newton’s cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle) device. Two balls are sufficient, but the more the merrier! Save the code in a file called _newton.js_.
- An animation of an Angry Bird launching then hitting a Bad Piggie. You can make the scene “scroll” to make it look like the bird is traveling a longer distance. Save this code in a file called _angry-bird.js_.

### JSFiddle Mini-Web Apps
Just as with the animation choices, the descriptions here are meant to represent just starting points. Embellish the requested behavior to taste, particularly with respect to CSS visual styling. Submissions for these apps comprise two (2) or possibly three (3) files: _.html_ and _.js_ for HTML and JavaScript, respectively, with an optional _.css_ file. For each program written, use the same name for all three (e.g., _change.html_, _change.js_, and _change.css_).

- A mini-web app that accepts an amount in cents and “makes change” for it, displaying the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that make up the amount. Place the code in files that start with _change_.
- A mini-web app that requests three (3) words in particular parts of speech then displays a “mad libs” sentence using these words. See if you can get a different sentence to appear each time. Place this code in files that start with _madlibs_.
- A mini-web app that computes the [body mass index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) based on user-entered height and weight. Place the code in files that start with _bmi_.
- A “voting machine” mini-web app that shows three buttons: one each for two candidates and a third for showing the results. Each click on a candidate button increases the vote count for that candidate. The vote counts are displayed when the results button is clicked. Place this code in files that start with _election_.
- A mini-web app that accepts a starting price and a percent discount, displaying the final discounted price. For example, $100 at a 5% discount is $95. Make sure that the percent is entered _as a percent rate_, and not its actual value (e.g., the user enters “20” for 20%, and not “0.2”). Place the code in files that start with _discount_.
- A mini-web app that accepts a distance to travel and a speed then displays the time remaining before arrival. Place this code in files that start with _trip-planner_.

## Tips and Advice

As mentioned in the beginning, this assignment is intended to get you into programming, fast and deep. We are focused primarily with putting something together that’s functional and fun. Keep your code readable, but don’t worry too much about that (yet). Just get things to work as intended. We will focus on craft, style, and technique in later assignments.
